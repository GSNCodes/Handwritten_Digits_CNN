# Handwritten_Digits_CNN

A CNN for classifying hand-written digits.

## Overview
This is one of my early attempts at applying CNNs.
I came accross it recently and I thought of updating the 
code using tensorflow and make it more readable.

## Dataset
MNIST Dataset is used.
Luckily, the MNIST data used here is present in the library itself 
and hence it saves us a lot of time.

## Accuracy
The accuracy achieved by my model architecture is around 97%.
Feel free to use a model of your choice to increase the accuracy as much as possible.
